# Techniques-and-Best-Practices-for-Effective-ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-in-Software-Development
In ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, I found out how to leverage a large language model (LLM) to create new and useful applications rapidly. With OpenAI API, you will be able to easily develop capabilities that can learn how to generate valuable innovations efficiently within a short period even if in the past.

The first notebook demonstrates the rules to be followed in the process.
The second notebook demonstrates step by step process of enhancement of iterative development of the task prompts.
the third notebook demonstrates the brief explanation on a topic if asked to ChatGPT LLM for outcomes.
The fourth notebook demonstrates the extraction of important eye-catching required information which is useful to the audience.
The fifth notebook demonstrates the operations of the LLM as prompts related with different languages and their detections, translations, transformations, and changing of tones.
The sixth notebook demonstrates the expanded results of certain texts entered by users as input to huge answers with respect to the prompts passed on.
The seventh notebook demonstrates the creation of ChatBot and OrderBot.
